Selection Sort aka Brute Force
find smallest and exchange with 1st position - find 2nd smallest and swap to 2nd position etc. 
O(N ^2) comparisons.
Good for small files. 
O(N) time taken. 

2nd array costs time and memory. 

Quicksort 
divide and conquer. 
fastest sorting algorithm. 
Good for large files of N. 
Pick pivot and move array items. 
Recursive. 
Worst Case O(N ^2) 
Average O(n log n) if pivot chosen correctly. 

Worst case = max # of steps taken 

Big O Notations. 
O(1) always terminates in the same amount of time. 
O(log N) fixed time
O(N) twice as long is input doubles
O(N ^2) four times as long if input doubles. 
O(2 ^N) increases exponentially as size increases. 

Hash Table.
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. 
It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.

Auxiliary Array.
Auxiliary data structure is a fancy way of saying helper data structure. 
Something you might use to solve a given problem and is terminated after the problem is solved.
Takes up temporary space for a period of time unlike a hash table.
