Selection Sort aka Brute Force
find smallest and exchange with 1st position - find 2nd smallest and swap to 2nd position etc. 
O(N ^2) comparisons.
Good for small files. 
O(N) time taken. 

2nd array costs time and memory. 

Quicksort 
divide and conquer. 
fastest sorting algorithm. 
Good for large files of N. 
Pick pivot and move array items. 
Recursive. 
Worst Case O(N ^2) 
Average O(n log n) if pivot chosen correctly. 

Worst case = max # of steps taken 

Big O Notations. 
O(1) always terminates in the same amount of time. 
O(log N) fixed time
O(N) twice as long is input doubles
O(N ^2) four times as long if input doubles. 
O(2 ^N) increases exponentially as size increases.
